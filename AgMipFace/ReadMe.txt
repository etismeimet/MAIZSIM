I used a file structure like this:
D:\MAIZSIM07\AgMipFace
with two subdirectories:
Braun07 and Braun06

There were 4 scenerios for each year:
Amb_D
Amb_W
Ele_D
Ele_W
Elevated and Ambient CO2 with wet and dry irrigation treatments

The run files are named as 
Run_Amb_W.dat in each of the year folders (Braun07, etc)
The files in AgMipFace.zip should go into the root folder (AgMipFace). 
These are common to all the simulations.
